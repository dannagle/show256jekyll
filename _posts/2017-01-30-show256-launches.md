[Michael Carroll](https://twitter.com/carromj) shared a link to an article on [completing twelve side projects in twelve months](https://blog.1ppm.club/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e#.oxx7q03gt) to a mutual [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3210.io/) as a suggestion for new year's resolutions. He talked about having regularly recurring in-person checkins at CoWorking Night for everyone who wanted to commit to the goal, but I'm consistently unavailable during the evenings, so I decided to create an accountability website, somewhat like [the MegaMaker challenge](http://live.megamaker.co/).

For the [first iteration of this site](http://show256.herokuapp.com/), I deployed [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org/) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). My only experience prior with WordPress was deploying to a LAMP stack. While it was fun and I learned a lot, I realized that I didn't want to pay to keep the instance awake and I was not happy with the load times.

Next, I turned my attention to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), another first for me. I took ~~inspiration~~ [lots of open source markup](https://github.com/mijustin/brutal-theme) from [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin), [other code](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware) from [the Haufe Group](https://www.haufe-lexware.com/), and created a [custom theme](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-jekyll-theme--cms-26332). My next step for the site will be to convert the theme to a [gem](https://www.chrisanthropic.com/blog/2016/creating-gem-based-themes-for-jekyll/).
